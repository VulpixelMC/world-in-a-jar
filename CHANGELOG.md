* Fixed severe memory leaks.
* Jar scale maximum is now 64 (and shouldn't let you make it higher anymore).
* Slightly optimized world jar rendering.
* Players now spawn in the middle of the world jar (previously they would spawn +7.5 X, +7.5 Y from the position of the jar.)
* Fixed minor bugs.
* Removed Pineapple.
