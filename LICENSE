Commons Protection License, Version 2 (CmPLv2)

PREAMBLE

	This License is mainly intended as a license for software and closely related digital works. While many licenses serve as the documents where different flavors of liberal philosophy are enforced without a mind to the class struggle, the Commons Preservation License is not afraid to address such issues directly and institute protections in favor of the commons and the workers.
	This is not a Free Software or Open-Source license. Instead, it is a Common Software license, meant to act as a wedge when it comes to the expropriation of value from software projects while preserving the security of the users and contributors to the software.
	The CmPLv2 was proposed by the Revolutionary Technical Committee, and was approved via discussions, proposals and a simple-majority vote.
